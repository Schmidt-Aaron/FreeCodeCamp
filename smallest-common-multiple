Smallest Common Multiple
Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.

The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.

e.g. for 1 and 3 - find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

//start code
function smallestCommons(arr) {
  // lets order the array from sm->lg
  var orderedArr = arr.sort(function(a , b) {
    return a - b;
  });
  
  //lets fill in the missing numbers to obtain all of the numbers we need to check
  var fullArr = [];
  for(var i = orderedArr[0]; i <= orderedArr[1]; i++) {
    fullArr.push(i);
  }
  
 
  //we can save time by starting at the multiple of the two highest numbers and then increase loop by the largest number
  //can probably optimize further
  var increment = fullArr[fullArr.length -1]; // this is how much we will advance the counter each loop
  var start = increment * fullArr[fullArr.length - 2]; //starting number
 

  //loop that checks if the current number is evenly divisible by all the numbers in the array
  // if not it increases the number and starts the loop over again
  //returns the number otherwise
      for (var j = fullArr.length -1; j >= 0;) {
        if (start % fullArr[j] !== 0) {
          start += increment;
          j = fullArr.length -1; //starts counter over again.
        } else if(start % fullArr[j] === 0) {
          j--; // counts down if number is divisible
        }
      }
      
      return start;
    } // end function
